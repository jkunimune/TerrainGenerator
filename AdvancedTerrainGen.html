<p>This program generates spherical terrain similarly to Civi-HD. However, it is designed to be much more realistic at the expense of taking much longer. As such, plates will actually move around, and biomes will vary more over longitude.</p>

<p><h2>How Does it Work?</h2></p>
<p>The program starts with a spherical mesh of tiles and edges. The tiles have edges parallel to lines of latitude and longitude such that all appear rectangular on an equirectangular map. Tiles are fused with their horizontal neighbors near the poles to keep the areas of the tiles roughly the same. An edge marks as adjacent any two tiles that share a border (corners don't count). This gives a decent approximation of a sphere.</p>
<p>A few of these tiles are randomly assigned an alititude. Over time, tiles take on altitudes similar to those next to them, and continents thus spread across the map until every tile has an altitude. Next, these tiles are broken up based on which altitude seed they spawned from, and assigned a tectonic plate with some angular velocity and angular acceleration. These plates shift around for eight timesteps; where they intersect, they add creating mountain ranges and trenches. Where they leave a gap, the tiles left without a plate take half their value from the last timestep (zero being sea level), creating valleys and rifts. Once the plates have found their final positions, the sea level rises or falls (usually rises) in order to make about 70% of the planet's surface below sea level. Any "oceans" created that are smaller than a certain number of Tiles are made into lakes.</p>
<p>Next, rivers are formed. The program looks at all edges where one tile is ocean (or connected to ocean via river) and the other is land or lake. It picks the one with the steepest drop in altitude and puts a river on that edge, flowing toward the ocean tile. It repeats until every land or lake tile has a chain of rivers flowing from it to the ocean. Tiles are assigned a water value equal to the number of tiles upriver of them (simulating a watershed), and all tiles with a big enough water value end up with the &quot;freshwater&quot; biome.</p>
<p>Finally, all of the other biomes must be created. Each tile gets a rainfall value, which is greatest near the equator and near bodies of water, and a temperature value, which increases gradually toward the equator and decreases with altitude. A few tiles are seeded with a biome value, either tundra, forest, desert, plains, jungle, ocean, ice, or reef, based on their rainfalls and temperatures. After that, biomes spread similarly to continents for a certain number of iterations. Any tiles that were not reached by a spreading biome are assigned a biome in the same manner as the biome seeds.</p>
<p>Once all of that is done, you're left with a randomly generated world with continents, mountain ranges, rivers, and biomes!</p>
