# TerrainGenerator
Generates terrain onto a spherical surface, and then spawns onto it colorful little empires called Civis.
Watch Civis grow, war, rebel, advance, and inevitably collapse, just like real civilizations!

For the full Civi package, run CiviHD.jar. For more advanced terraing generation, run TerrainGenerator.jar. CiviInSpace.jar runs CiviHD on a galactic scale, and MapTest.jar compares some of the different supported map projections.

Left-click and hold on a tile to see what it is, and right-click to drop meteors.
