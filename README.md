# TerrainGenerator
Generates terrain onto a spherical surface, and then spawns onto it colorful little empires called Civis.
Watch Civis grow, war, rebel, advance, and inevitably collapse, just like real civilizations!

NOTE: The driver for a basic terrain generator is TerrainGenerator.java. For the full Civi package, use CiviHD.java. Open with Dr. Java.
