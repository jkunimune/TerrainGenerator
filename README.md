# TerrainGenerator
Generates terrain onto a spherical surface, and then spawns onto it colorful little empires called Civis.
Watch Civis grow, war, rebel, advance, and inevitably collapse, just like real civilizations!

The driver for a basic terrain generator is TerrainGenerator.class. For the full Civi package, use CiviHD.class.  Click and hold on a tile to see what it is, and right-click to drop meteors.
